## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Current Limitations
- **Storage**: Currently uses browser LocalStorage for demo purposes
- **File Persistence**: Files are stored locally and won't persist across devices
- **Sharing**: Share links work only on the same device/browser

### Production Deployment Requirements

For a fully functional public video hosting platform, you'll need:

1. **Backend Storage Service**:
   - AWS S3 + CloudFront
   - Google Cloud Storage
   - Azure Blob Storage
   - Or similar cloud storage solution

2. **Database**:
   - PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB
   - For storing video metadata and user information

3. **Video Processing**:
   - FFmpeg for video transcoding
   - Multiple resolution support
   - Thumbnail generation service

4. **CDN**:
   - Content Delivery Network for global video streaming
   - Reduced latency and improved performance

## üîß Configuration
